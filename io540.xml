This is an aeio-540 300 hp
6-cylinder Fuel injected horizontally-opposed air-cooled piston engine, Lubricated for Aerobatic performance used by Extra300L

According to my Extra, its idle range is around below 1000rpm-650rpm. 650-800 Depends on the temputure when we fly it
The rpms very slightly jump up and down at the rev lim. for a second and then its smooth, This dose not happen while airborn
Max RPM to 2700 as allways
Other things from the Operaters hand book
